Welcome to glumpy's documentation!
==================================

glumpy is a small python library for the rapid vizualization of numpy arrays,
(mainly two dimensional) that has been designed with efficiency in mind. If you
want to draw nice figures for inclusion in a scientific article, you'd better
use `matplotlib <http://http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_. If you want to
have a sense of what's going on in your simulation while it is running, then
glumpy can help you.
